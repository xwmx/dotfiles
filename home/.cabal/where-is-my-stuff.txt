**********************************************************************

=== Configuration for cabal has been written to
    ~/.cabal/config

=== Executables will be installed in:
    ~/Library/Haskell/bin

    You may wish to place this on your PATH by adding the following
    line to your ~/.bash_profile:

    export PATH="$HOME/Library/Haskell/bin:$PATH"

=== When documentation is built, a master index to all documentation
    will be placed in:

    ~/Library/Haskell/doc/index.html

    You may wish to bookmark that file once it gets built (after the
    first cabal install).
